                    <h2>Peeking into a world of spin-3/2 materials</h2>

                    Researchers have been pushing the frontiers of the quantum world for over a century. And time after
                    time, spin has been a rich source of new physics.

                    <img src="../../Photos/Oeeking.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Spin, like mass and electrical charge, is an intrinsic property of quantum particles. It is
                        central
                        to understanding how quantum objects will respond to a magnetic field, and it divides all
                        quantum
                        objects into two types. The half-integer ones, like the spin-1/2 electron, refuse to share the
                        same
                        quantum state, whereas the integer ones, like the spin-1 photon, don't have a problem cozying up
                        together. So, spin is essential when delving into virtually any topic governed by quantum
                        mechanics,
                        from the Higgs Boson to superconductors.

                        Yet after almost a century of playing a central role in quantum research, questions about spin
                        remain. For example, why do all the elementary particles that we know about only have spin
                        values of
                        0, 1/2, or 1? And what new behaviors might exist for particles with spin values greater than 1?

                        The first question may remain a cosmic mystery, but there are opportunities to explore the
                        second.
                        Inside of a material, a particle's surroundings can cause it to behave like it has a new spin
                        value.
                        In the past couple years, researchers have discovered materials in which electrons behave like
                        their
                        spin has been bumped up, from 1/2 to 3/2. JQI postdoctoral researcher Igor Boettcher explored
                        the
                        new behaviors these spins might produce in a recent paper featured on the cover of Physical
                        Review
                        Letters.

                        Instead of looking at a particular material, Boettcher focused on the math that describes
                        interactions between spin-3/2 electrons at low temperatures. These electrons can interact in
                        more
                        ways than their mundane spin-1/2 counterparts, which unlocks new phases—or collective
                        behaviors—that
                        researchers can look for in experiments. Boettcher sifted through the possible phases, searching
                        for
                        the ones that are likely to be stable at low temperatures. He looked at which phases tie up the
                        least energy in the interactions, since as the temperature drops a material becomes most stable
                        in
                        the form containing the least energy (like steam condensing into liquid water and eventually
                        freezing into ice).

                        He found three promising phases to hunt for in experiments. Which of these phases, if any, arise
                        in
                        a particular material will depend on its unique properties. Still, Boettcher's predictions
                        provide
                        researchers with signals to keep an eye out for during experiments. If one of the phases forms,
                        he
                        predicts that common measurement techniques will reveal a signature shift in the electrical
                        properties.

                        Boettcher's work is an early step in the exploration of spin-3/2 materials. He hopes that one
                        day
                        the field might be comparable to that of graphene, with researchers constantly racing to explore
                        new
                        physics, produce better quality materials, and identify new transport properties.

                        "I really hope that this will develop into a big field, which will require both experimentalists
                        and
                        the theorists to do their part so that we can really learn something about the spin-3/2
                        particles
                        and how they interact." says Boettcher. "This is really just the beginning right now, because
                        these
                        materials just popped up."
