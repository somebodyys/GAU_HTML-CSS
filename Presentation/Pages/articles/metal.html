                    <h2>Scientists find a rule to predict new superconducting metal hydrides</h2>
                    <img src="../../Photos/Metal.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        The search for coveted high-temperature superconductors is going to get easier with a new 'law
                        within a law' discovered by Skoltech and MIPT researchers and their colleagues, who figured out
                        a
                        link between an element's position in the Periodic Table and its potential to form a
                        high-temperature superconducting hydride. The new paper is published in the journal Current
                        Opinion
                        in Solid State & Materials Science. The research was supported by the Russian Science
                        Foundation.

                        Superconducting materials, with zero resistance and thus no dissipation of energy to heat, would
                        be
                        extremely useful for our electronics and power grids. Superconducting magnets are already used
                        in
                        the MRI machine at your local hospital and in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron
                        Collider at CERN.

                        Right now there are two ways to get to superconductivity, both at the extremes: very low
                        temperatures or very high pressures. Some of the "warmest" superconductors of the first kind,
                        cuprates, still require to be cooled down to some 100 K (-173 °C), which is a far cry from
                        normal
                        conditions. There are predictions that metallic hydrogen can show superconducting properties at
                        almost room temperature; the catch is in the pressure required, which is more than 4 million
                        atmospheres, almost at the limit of our technical capabilities.

                        That is why scientists are looking at hydrides, compounds of hydrogen and another element, and
                        it
                        has been shown that they work as superconductors at relatively high temperatures and lower
                        pressures. The current record of up to minus 23 degrees C was shown last year for LaH10,
                        lanthanum
                        decahydride, at the pressure of 170 gigapascals, or 1.7 million atmospheres. Even though
                        pressures
                        are still too high to enable practical use, research in superconducting hydrides already has
                        important implications for other classes of superconductors, which could function at normal
                        pressure
                        and temperature.

                        Skoltech Ph.D. student Dmitrii Semenok and Skoltech and MIPT Professor Artem R. Oganov together
                        with
                        their colleagues have found a rule that allows predicting the maximum superconducting critical
                        temperature, maxTC, for a metal hydride based only on the electronic structure of metal atoms.
                        This
                        means that the search for new superconducting hydrides is going to get easier.

                        "The connection between superconductivity and the Periodic Table was puzzling at first. We are
                        still
                        not fully certain about its origin, but we think that it is because elements at the boundary
                        between
                        s- and p- or s- and d-elements (roughly between 2nd and 3rd groups of the Table) have electronic
                        structure unusually sensitive to the crystal field, and this is perfect for the electron-phonon
                        coupling, which is the cause of superconductivity in hydrides," said Artem R. Oganov, a
                        co-author of
                        the work.

                        In addition to discovering a qualitative rule, they also trained a neural network to predict
                        maxTC
                        for compounds where no experimental or theoretical data was available. For some elements,
                        previously
                        published data on Tc of hydrides seemed to deviate from regular behavior. The researchers then
                        set
                        out to check these data by using USPEX, the evolutionary algorithm developed by Oganov and his
                        students for predicting thermodynamically stable hydrides of these elements.

                        "For elements where the published values of maxTc were (based on the discovered rule) too low or
                        too
                        high, the group performed systematic searches for stable hydrides. Their new data confirmed the
                        discovered rule and yielded new hydrides for magnesium (Mg), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), cesium
                        (Cs) and rubidium (Rb). For instance, a predicted strontium hexahydride, SrH6, has a maxTC of
                        189 K
                        (minus 84 degrees C) at 100 GPa, while BaH12, a theoretical barium superhydride, may have a
                        relatively high maxTC up to 214 K (minus 59 degrees C)," said Alexander Kvashnin, Skoltech and
                        MIPT
                        senior research scientist and a co-author of the research.

                        Earlier in 2019, Oganov and his colleagues from Russia, the US and China synthesized cerium
                        superhydride CeH9, which has superconducting properties at 100-110 K and at a (relatively) low
                        pressure of 120 GPa. Another superconductor discovered by the research group (Dmitry Semenok,
                        Ivan
                        Troyan, Alexander Kvashnin, Artem R. Oganov, and their colleagues), thorium hydride ThH10, has a
                        high critical temperature of 161 K.

                        "Now, using the newly discovered rule and the neural network we can focus on more complex
                        compounds
                        which are even more promising in our quest for room-temperature superconductivity—ternary
                        superhydrides that contain two elements and hydrogen. We have already predicted a number of
                        hydrides
                        that can rival or exceed LaH10," said the first author of the work, Dmitrii Semenok.
