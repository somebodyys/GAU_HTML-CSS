                    <h1>Applying mathematics to accelerate predictions for capturing fusion energy</h1>

                    <p>
                        A key issue for scientists seeking to bring the fusion that powers the sun and stars to Earth is
                        forecasting the performance of the volatile plasma that fuels fusion reactions. Making such
                        predictions calls for considerable costly time on the world's fastest supercomputers. Now
                        researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL)
                        have
                        borrowed a technique from applied mathematics to accelerate the process.

                        The technique combines the millisecond behavior of fusion plasmas into longer-term forecasts. By
                        using it, "we were able to demonstrate that accurate predictions of quantities such as plasma
                        temperature profiles and heat fluxes could be achieved at a much reduced computational cost,"
                        said
                        Ben Sturdevant, an applied mathematician at PPPL and lead author of a Physics of Plasmas paper
                        that
                        reported the results.

                        Fusion combines light elements in the form of plasma—the hot, charged state of matter composed
                        of
                        free electrons and atomic nuclei—that generates massive amounts of energy. Scientists are
                        working
                        around the world to create and control fusion on Earth for a virtually inexhaustible supply of
                        safe
                        and clean power to generate electricity.

                    <h3>
                        Speeding simulations
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Sturdevant applied the mathematical technique to the high-performance XGCa plasma code developed
                        by
                        a team led by physicist C.S. Chang at PPPL. The application greatly speeded up simulations of
                        the
                        evolving temperature profile of ions orbiting around magnetic field lines modeled with
                        gyrokinetics—a widely used model that provides a detailed microscopic description of the
                        behavior of
                        plasma in strong magnetic fields. Also accelerated was modeling the collisions between orbiting
                        particles that cause heat to leak from the plasma and reduce its performance.

                        The application was the first successful use of the technique, called "equation-free projective
                        integration," to model the evolution of the ion temperature as colliding particles escape from
                        magnetic confinement. Equation free modeling aims to extract long-term macroscopic information
                        from
                        short-term microscopic simulations. The key was improving a critical aspect of the technique
                        called
                        a "lifting operator" to map the large-scale, or macroscopic, states of plasma behavior onto
                        small-scale, or microscopic, ones.

                        The modification brought the detailed profile of the ion temperature into sharp relief. "Rather
                        than
                        directly simulating the evolution over a long time-scale, this method uses a number of
                        millisecond
                        simulations to make predictions over a longer time-scale," Sturdevant said. "The improved
                        process
                        reduced the computing time by a factor of four."

                        The results, based on tokamak simulations, are general and could be adapted for other magnetic
                        fusion devices including stellarators and even for other scientific applications. "This is an
                        important step in being able to confidently predict performance in fusion energy devices from
                        first-principles-based physics," Sturdevant said.
                    </p>



                    <h3>
                        Expanding the technique
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        He next plans to consider the effect of expanding the technique to include the evolution of
                        turbulence on the speed of the process. "Some of these initial results are promising and
                        exciting,"
                        Sturdevant said. "We're very interested to see how it will work with the inclusion of
                        turbulence."

                        Coauthors of the paper include Chang, PPPL physicist Robert Hager and physicist Scott Parker of
                        the
                        University of Colorado. Chang and Parker were advisors, Sturdevant said, while Hager provided
                        help
                        with the XGCa code and the computational analysis.
