                    <h1>Why didn't the universe annihilate itself? Neutrinos may hold the answer</h1>

                    <img src="../../Photos/Universe.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Alysia Marino and Eric Zimmerman, physicists at CU Boulder, have been on the hunt for neutrinos
                        for
                        the last two decades.

                        That's no easy feat: Neutrinos are among the most elusive subatomic particles known to science.
                        They
                        don't have a charge and are so lightweight—each one has a mass many times smaller than the
                        electron—that they interact only on rare occasions with the world around them.

                        They may also hold the key to some of physics' deepest mysteries.

                        In a study published today in the journal Nature, Marino, Zimmerman and more than 400 other
                        researchers on an experiment called T2K come closer to answering one of the big ones: Why didn't
                        the
                        universe annihilate itself in a humungous burst of energy not long after the Big Bang?</p>
                    <p>
                        The new research suggests that the answer comes down to a subtle discrepancy in the way that
                        neutrinos and their evil twins, the antineutrinos, behave—one of the first indications that
                        phenomena called matter and antimatter may not be the exact mirror images many scientists
                        believed.

                        The group's findings showcase what scientists can learn by studying these unassuming particles,
                        said
                        Zimmerman, a professor in the Department of Physics.

                        "Even 20 years ago, the field of neutrino physics was much smaller than it is today," he said.

                        Marino, an associate professor of physics, agreed. "There's still a lot we're trying to
                        understand
                        about how neutrinos interact," she said.

                    <h3>Big Bang</h3>

                    <p>
                        Neutrinos, which weren't directly detected until the 1950s, are often produced deep within stars
                        and
                        are among the most common particles in the universe. Ever second, trillions of them pass through
                        your body, although few if any will react with a single one of your atoms.

                        To understand why this cosmic dandelion fluff is important, it helps to go back to the
                        beginning—the
                        very beginning.

                        Based on their calculations, physicists believe that the Big Bang must have created a huge
                        amount of
                        matter alongside an equal quantity of antimatter. These particles behave exactly like, but have
                        opposite charges from, the protons, electrons and all the other matter that makes up everything
                        you
                        can see around you.

                        There's just one problem with that theory: Matter and antimatter obliterate each other on
                        contact.

                        "Our universe today is dominated by matter and not antimatter," Marino said. "So there had to be
                        some process in physics that distinguished matter from antimatter and could have given rise to a
                        small excess of protons or electrons over their antiparticles."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, that small excess became a big excess until there was virtually no antimatter left in
                        the
                        cosmos. According to one popular theory, neutrinos underly that discrepancy.

                        Zimmerman explained that these subatomic particles come in three different types, which
                        scientists
                        call "flavors," with unique interactions. They are the muon neutrino, electron neutrino and tau
                        neutrino. You can think of them as the physicist's Neapolitan ice cream.

                        These flavors, however, don't stay put. They oscillate. If you give them enough time, for
                        example,
                        the odds that a muon neutrino will stay a muon neutrino can shift. Imagine opening your freezer
                        and
                        not knowing whether the vanilla ice cream you left behind will now be chocolate or strawberry,
                        instead.

                        But is the same true for antineutrinos? Proponents of the theory of "leptogenesis" argue that if
                        there were even a small difference in how these mirror images behave, it could go a long way
                        toward
                        explaining the imbalance in the universe.

                        "The next big step in neutrino physics is to understand whether neutrino oscillations happen at
                        the
                        same rate as antineutrino oscillations," Zimmerman said.

                    <p>
                        That, however, means observing neutrinos up close.

                        The T2K, or Tokai to Kamioka, Experiment goes to extreme lengths to do just that. In this
                        effort,
                        scientists use a particle accelerator to shoot beams made up of neutrinos from a research site
                        in
                        Tokai, Japan, to detectors in Kamioka—a distance of more than 180 miles or the entire width of
                        Japan's largest island, Honshu.

                        Zimmerman and Marino have both participated in the collaboration since the 2000s. For the last
                        nine
                        years, the duo and their colleagues from around the world have traded off studying beams of muon
                        neutrinos and muon antineutrinos.

                        In their most recent study, the researchers hit pay dirt: These bits of matter and antimatter
                        seem
                        to behave differently. Muon neutrinos, Zimmerman said, are more inclined to oscillate into
                        electron
                        neutrinos than their antineutrino counterparts.

                        The results come with major caveats. The team's findings are still quite a bit shy of the
                        physics
                        community's gold standard for a discovery, a measure of statistical significance called
                        "five-sigma." The T2K collaboration is already upgrading the experiment so that it can collect
                        more
                        data and faster to reach that mark.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But, Marino said, the results provide one of the most tantalizing hints to date that some kinds
                        of
                        matter and antimatter may act differently—and not by a trivial amount.

                        "To explain the T2K results, the difference needs to be almost the largest amount that you could
                        possibly get" based on theory, she said.

                        Marino sees the study as one window to the fascinating world of neutrinos. There are many more
                        pressing questions around these particles, too: How much, for example, does each flavor of
                        neutrino
                        weigh? Are neutrinos, in a really weird twist, actually their own antiparticles? She and
                        Zimmerman
                        are taking part in a second collaboration, an upcoming effort called the Deep Underground
                        Neutrino
                        Experiment (DUNE), that will aid the upgraded T2K in finding those answers.

                        "There are still things we're figuring out because neutrinos are so hard to produce in a lab and
                        require such complicated detectors," Marino said. "There's still room for more surprises."
