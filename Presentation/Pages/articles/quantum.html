                    <h1>Speeding-up quantum computing using giant atomic ions</h1>
                    <img src="../../Photos/quamtum.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>
                        Trapped Rydberg ions may be the next step towards scaling up quantum computers to sizes where
                        they
                        can be practically usable, a new study in Nature shows.

                        Different physical systems can be used to make a quantum computer. Trapped ions that form a
                        crystal
                        have led the research field for years, but when the system is scaled up to large ion crystals
                        this
                        method gets very slow. Complex arithmetic operations cannot be performed fast enough before the
                        stored quantum information decays.

                        A Stockholm University research group may have solved this problem by using giant Rydberg ions,
                        100
                        million times larger than normal atoms or ions. These huge ions are highly interactive and,
                        therefore, can exchange quantum information in less than a microsecond.

                        "In a sense, Rydberg ions form small antennas for exchanging quantum information and thus make
                        it
                        possible to realize particularly fast quantum gates, which are the 'basic building blocks' of a
                        quantum computer," explains Markus Hennrich, Department of Physics, Stockholm University, and
                        group
                        leader from the Stockholm University team. "The interaction between Rydberg ions is not based on
                        crystal vibrations, as with ions trapped in crystal form, but on the exchange of photons. The
                        fast
                        interaction between the Rydberg ions can be used to create quantum entanglement."

                    <p>
                        "We used this interaction to carry out a quantum computing operation (an entangling gate) that
                        is
                        around 100 times faster than is typical in trapped ion systems," explains Chi Zhang, researcher
                        at
                        the Department of Physics, Stockholm University.

                        Theoretical calculations supporting the experiment have been conducted by Igor Lesanovsky and
                        Weibin
                        Li at University of Nottingham, UK and University of Tübingen, Germany.

                        "Our theoretical work confirmed that there is indeed no slowdown expected once the ion crystals
                        become larger, highlighting the prospect of a scalable quantum computer," says Igor Lesanovsky
                        from
                        University of Tübingen.

                        Quantum computers are regarded as one of the key technologies of the 21st century. While
                        conventional computers function according to the laws of classical physics, quantum computers
                        work
                        according to the rules of quantum mechanics. The ability of entangled quanta to exchange
                        information
                        without time delay makes them very fast and powerful. In the future, quantum computers could be
                        used
                        wherever complex calculations need to be solved, for example in the design of new medications or
                        in
                        artificial intelligence.
