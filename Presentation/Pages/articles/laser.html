                    <h2>Testing how accurately X-ray lasers can measure the inner workings of biological molecules</h2>
                    <img src="../../Photos/Laser.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        One of the great advantages of X-ray free-electron lasers like the one at the Department of
                        Energy's
                        SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is that they allow researchers to determine the structure
                        of
                        biological molecules in natural environments. This is important if you want to study how a
                        potential
                        new drug interacts with a virus in conditions similar to those found in the human body. By
                        hitting
                        these samples with ultrashort X-ray laser pulses, scientists can collect data in the instant
                        before
                        damage from the X-rays has time to propagate through the sample.

                        But is there really zero damage to samples examined by this method, which is known as
                        "diffraction
                        before destruction"? Knowing the answer at finer and finer scales of measurement is important
                        for
                        analyzing the results of these experiments and understanding how biological molecules do their
                        work.
                        Such understanding is critical in designing drugs to effectively target specific diseases.

                        Thanks to a two-color X-ray laser technique developed at SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source
                        (LCLS),
                        an experiment at LCLS is testing this technique to limits never before seen.

                        A team led by Ilme Schlichting of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research and SÃ©bastien
                        Boutet
                        of SLAC hit two types of crystallized biological molecules with pairs of X-ray laser pulses that
                        had
                        slightly different wavelengths and were up to 100 femtoseconds, millionths of a billionth of a
                        second, apart. The first pulse passed through the sample and was absorbed by a foil filter. The
                        second one scattered off the sample, passed through the filter and entered a detector, forming
                        patterns that could be analyzed to recreate the structure of the sample's molecules and measure
                        any
                        changes caused by the first pulse.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this method, the team found that the parts of a molecule that contain atoms heavier than
                        oxygen
                        absorbed the brunt of the X-ray damage. Chains of carbon atoms, which form the backbone of all
                        proteins, also saw changes over time, but to a much smaller degree. These changes were not
                        consistent throughout the entire molecule, occurring more in certain areas than in others, and
                        they
                        increased as the time between pulses was increased. These results show that in order to make
                        reliable measurements, researchers need to model these specific parts of a sample rather than
                        assuming all parts of the molecule are equally damaged.

                        This study, published in Nature Communications, is the beginning of a fuller understanding of
                        how
                        very short X-ray pulses produced by X-ray lasers like LCLS modify the structure of biological
                        molecules. The team concluded that "diffraction before destruction" is an effective method of
                        determining the structure of biological molecules, so long as scientists consider the intensity
                        and
                        duration of the pulses used to study them when interpreting their results. Such knowledge can be
                        applied across the wide range of studies being undertaken at these facilities, which range from
                        investigating new ways of combating mosquito-borne diseases to studying the virulence of deadly
                        pathogens and developing a better understanding of anti-asthmatic drugs.
