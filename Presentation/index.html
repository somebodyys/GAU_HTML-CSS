                <h3>What is an individual? Information theory may provide the answer</h3>
                <article>
                    It's almost impossible to imagine biology without individuals—individual organisms, individual
                    cells, and individual genes, for example. But what about a worker ant that never reproduces, and
                    could never survive apart from the colony? Are the trillions of microorganisms in our microbiomes,
                    which vastly outnumber our human cells, part of our individuality?

                    "Despite the near-universal assumption of individuality in biology, there is little agreement about
                    what individuals are and few rigorous quantitative methods for their identification," write the
                    authors of new work published in the journal Theory in Biosciences. The problem, they note in the
                    paper, is analogous to identifying a figure from its background in a Gestalt psychology drawing.
                    Like the famous image of two faces outlining a vase, an individual life form and its environment
                    create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

                    <p>
                        One way to solve the puzzle comes from information theory. Instead of focusing on anatomical
                        traits,
                        like cell walls, SFI President David Krakauer, Nils Bertschinger of the Frankfurt Institute for
                        Advanced Studies, Eckehard Olbrich of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences,
                        SFI
                        Professor Jessica Flack, and SFI Professor Nihat Ay (also of the Max Planck Institute for
                        Mathematics in the Sciences) look to structured information flows between a system and its
                        environment. "Individuals," they argue, "are best thought of in terms of dynamical processes and
                        not
                        as stationary objects."

                        The individual as a verb: what processes produce distinct identity? Flack stresses that this
                        lens
                        allows for individuality to be "continuous rather than binary, nested, and possible at any
                        level."
                        An information theory of individuality (or ITI) describes emergent agency at different scales
                        and
                        with distributed communication networks (e.g., both ants and colonies at once).

                        The authors use a model that suggests three kinds of individual, each corresponding to a
                        different
                        blend of self-regulation and environmental influence. Decomposing information like this gives a
                        gradient: it ranges from environmentally-scaffolded forms like whirlpools, to
                        partially-scaffolded
                        colonial forms like coral reefs and spider webs, to organismal individuals that are sculpted by
                        their environment but strongly self-organizing.

                        Each is a strategy for propagating information forward through time—meaning, Flack adds,
                        "individuality is about temporal uncertainty reduction." Replication here emerges as just one of
                        many strategies for individuals to order information in their future. To Flack, this "leaves us
                        free
                        to ask what role replication plays in temporal uncertainty reduction through the creation of
                        individuals," a question close to asking why we find life in the first place.

                        Perhaps the biggest implication of this work is in how it places the observer at the center of
                        evolutionary theory. "Just as in quantum mechanics," Krakauer says, "where the state of a system
                        depends on measurement, the measurements we call natural selection dictate the preferred form of
                        the
                        individual. Who does the measuring? What we find depends on what the observer is capable of
                        seeing."

                <h3>Bactericidal nanomachine: Researchers reveal the mechanisms behind a natural bacteria killer</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Scientists are one step closer to adapting the bacteria-killing power of a naturally occurring
                        nanomachine, a tiny particle that performs a mechanical action.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a study published in Nature, a UCLA-led team of researchers describe how the nanomachine
                        recognizes and kills bacteria, and report that they have imaged it at atomic resolution. The
                        scientists also engineered their own versions of the nanomachine, which enabled them to produce
                        variations that behaved differently from the naturally occurring version.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Their efforts could eventually lead to the development of new types of antibiotics that are
                        capable
                        of homing in on specific species of microbes. Drugs tailored to kill only a certain species or
                        strain of bacteria could offer numerous advantages over conventional antibiotics, including
                        lowering
                        the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance. In addition, the tailored drugs could
                        destroy
                        harmful cells without wiping out beneficial bugs in the gut microbiome, and they could
                        eventually
                        offer the possibilities of being deployed to prevent bacterial infections, to kill pathogens in
                        food
                        and to engineer human microbiomes so that favorable bacteria thrive.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The particle in the study, an R-type pyocin, is a protein complex released by the bacterium
                        Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a way of sabotaging microbes that compete with it for resources. When
                        a
                        pyocin identifies a rival bacterium, it kills the bacterium by punching a hole in the cell's
                        membrane. P. aeruginosa, frequently a cause of hospital-acquired illness, is found in soil, in
                        water
                        and on fresh produce. The germ is commonly studied and its biology is well understood.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Observing a pyocin's molecular structure—in its configurations both before and after that
                        hole-punching—enabled the scientists to figure out the mechanisms by which it recognizes its
                        prey
                        and triggers its killing blow.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        The research falls under the banner of a discipline called bioinspired engineering, which aims
                        to
                        develop technology that takes its design cues from nature. The results of the new study could
                        contribute to the development of targeted antibiotics based on a pyocin.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "If you tried to design a pyocin from scratch, you probably couldn't do it," said Z. Hong Zhou,
                        the
                        study's co-corresponding author and the faculty director of the Electron Imaging Center for
                        Nanomachines at the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. "It's good to learn from nature,
                        because nature has developed and tested these systems over billions of years. That should help
                        us
                        from an engineering standpoint."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With his colleagues, Zhou—who also is a UCLA professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular
                        genetics—used two imaging technologies: X-ray crystallography, which reveals the structure of
                        crystallized molecules using X-rays, and cryo-electron microscopy, which forms images by
                        detecting
                        electrons rebounding from frozen samples. The team was aided by recent advances in electron
                        microscopy, including higher-speed cameras that directly detect electrons; previous versions of
                        the
                        technique detected electrons indirectly and, as a result, with less detail.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As described in the study, pyocins are elegantly simple and specific killing machines.

                        Earlier research by the leaders of the new study described the pyocin's overall structure,
                        albeit in
                        less detail. The largest part of a pyocin is a cylindrical trunk comprising an outer sheath that
                        surrounds an inner tube—the part that punctures. At the bottom of the trunk is a baseplate with
                        six
                        protruding tendrils. When the nanomachine encounters a bacterial cell, it lands on the cell and
                        the
                        tendrils bind to specific structures on the cell's surface.

                        In the new paper, the scientists described for the first time a six-stranded collar at the top
                        of
                        the pyocin's trunk, which connects the sheath and inner tube and is important for transmitting
                        energy in the process of triggering the pyocin.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        The latest study also provided previously unknown information about the mechanical action that
                        takes
                        place when a pyocin is triggered: When at least three of the six tendrils bind to the surface of
                        a
                        bacterial cell, the pyocin recognizes that the cell is the specific type of bacterium it is
                        meant to
                        attack. At that point, the tendrils anchor the pyocin to the cell and cause the baseplate to
                        splay
                        out. This, in turn, causes the outer sheath to collapse, driving the inner tube down and across
                        the
                        surface of the target cell.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond the puncture damage itself, the inner tube leaches energy from the bacterial cell, which
                        causes the cell to die—a detail previously revealed by the researchers.

                        "This is a mechanical system that's exquisitely tuned to couple specific recognition of a target
                        cell with deployment of its lethal blow," said co-corresponding author Jeff F. Miller, UCLA's
                        Fred
                        Kavli Professor of NanoSystems Sciences and the director of CNSI. "Understanding how the system
                        is
                        constructed and how its activity is controlled could be used for building new kinds of
                        nanomachines."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Using standard molecular biology techniques to alter the DNA of P. aeruginosa, the researchers
                        engineered variations of a pyocin. Among the variations were versions in which the trigger was
                        more
                        or less sensitive to the structures on the surface of its target bacteria and to its
                        environment.
                        For example, certain adjustments allowed the nanomachine to overcome its vulnerability to acidic
                        environments. In nature, the pyocin automatically triggers when exposed to a pH of 3.4, about
                        the
                        acidity of sauerkraut, but compared to the natural version, fewer of the engineered pyocins
                        triggered at that pH level.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The ability to tune the sensitivity of the pyocin's trigger has implications for antibiotics
                        that
                        could eventually be developed based on the study: A deadly systemic infection might be met with
                        a
                        "looser" trigger that doesn't discriminate as much in which bacteria the particle attacks, while
                        a
                        more discriminating trigger function could be used to target certain gut infections without
                        causing
                        collateral damage to the microbiome.

                        A scientist from Pylum Biosciences, a South San Francisco-based startup cofounded by Miller,
                        participated in the research. Pylum has engineered different classes of pyocins as the basis for
                        developing therapies that only attack specific species of bacteria, while overcoming antibiotic
                        resistance and preventing damage to beneficial microbes. One such therapy narrowly targets a
                        bacterium that causes colitis. The therapy has been tested in the lab and in preclinical animal
                        models, and clinical trials in human patients are being planned.
